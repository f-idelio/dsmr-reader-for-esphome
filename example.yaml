# The following are the sensors that I use.
# Look at the ESPHome documentation for the dsmr component for more options:
# https://esphome.io/components/sensor/dsmr.html

# Until fixed in ESPHome, some entries will need an extra annotation:
#  state_class: total_increasing
#  device_class: gas
# Otherwise they won't work together with Home Assistant's energy dashboard.
# Release of the fix is ESPHome version 2021.9.0
# See: https://github.com/esphome/issues/issues/2383
